# RunTracker

RunTracker is an application designed to help users log their running sessions efficiently. Users can record their runs by entering the date, distance, duration, and run type. The application allows users to create custom run types, which can be selected when registering new running sessions.

RunTracker offers full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for both RunningSessions and RunTypes, ensuring comprehensive data management. The application automatically creates a MongoDB database, provided that the user has entered their MongoDB connection string in the User Secrets.
